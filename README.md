# Vasicek Calibration and Yield Curve Modelling (WIP)

This repository is dedicated to exploring the calibration and modeling of one-factor short rates using the Vasicek interest rate model. The project aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing the Vasicek model for interest rate forecasting.
It provides an introduction to the Vasicek model and its mathematical framework and then it provides ways to calibrate the model using Linear Regression and Maximum Likelihood Estimation.
